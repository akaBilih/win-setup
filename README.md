# Windows 10 Setup Scripts

Windows 10 setup scripts for fresh installs

## Prerequisites

- A fresh install of Windows 10.
- If in China: prepare proxy software to access the true internet.

## Usage

Fork or download this repo, **MODIFY** the scripts and execute `setup.cmd` in your fresh installed computer.

**Run it as Administrator** to ensure that the script can run normally.

> The script has not been fully tested after each modification, please be careful if you are using it.
>
> Youâ€™d better understand what the scripts do if you run them. Some functions lower security, hide controls or uninstall applications. You'll most likely need to modify the scripts.

## Structure

### File

#### setup.cmd

Execute `setup.ps1` bypassing the default setting that does not allow `.ps1` scripts to be executed in Win10.

#### setup.ps1

Contains the main flow of the script, which calls functions in `setup.psm1`

#### setup.psm1

Some wrapped atomic operations are called by setup.ps1

#### tweaks.\*

Transplant from [Disassembler0/Win10-Initial-Setup-Script](https://github.com/Disassembler0/Win10-Initial-Setup-Script), a very comprehensive Win10 Initial Setup Script.

`tweaks.preset` is my custom preset. You'd better write a preset yourself compared with the original project.

#### Add_PS1_Run_as_administrator.reg

An **optional** registry. Import it to your registry can enable context menu on the powershell files to run as Administrator.
